# Van power supply system 

## Project Overview
In this project, I converted a van from the ground up. Here, the primary focus is on the **electrical circuit**. The van build was a comprehensive challenge that taught me a lot about **project management**, **forward planning**, and the setup of a functional and safe electrical system. 

## Electrical Circuit
The heart of this project was the **electrical system**, carefully designed and installed to reliably power all the devices in the van. The circuit consists of the following main components:

- **Solar System**: A solar panel mounted on the roof charges the onboard battery.
- **Battery System**: A 12V 150Ah lithium battery powers all the devices in the van. I learned the importance of properly calculating battery capacity to ensure there's enough power available throughout the day.
- **Inverter**: An inverter converts the 12V DC from the battery into 230V AC to run standard household appliances.- **Charger**: In addition to the solar panel, a charger is connected to charge the battery via the alternator while driving.
- **Shore Power Connection**: The system is also equipped with a shore power connection, allowing the battery to be charged directly from an external power source when the van is parked at a campsite or any other location with an electrical hookup.
- **Wiring and Safety**: All cables were sized correctly to minimize voltage drops and prevent overloading. Each component is protected by fuses and switches to ensure safety.
- **FI/LS Switch**: For additional safety, an FI/LS (RCD/MCB) switch was installed, providing protection against earth faults and overcurrent situations. This was critical to ensure that both myself and the system are protected from electrical hazards.

### What I Learned
During the planning and installation of the electrical circuit, I gained valuable insights into both **project management** and **technology**:
- **Forward Planning**: It was essential to anticipate future needs, such as calculating the energy consumption of devices and determining the required battery capacity. Careful planning helped avoid changes later in the process.
- **Risk Management**: There were numerous safety aspects to consider, such as proper fusing and the use of an FI/LS switch to prevent electrical faults or fires. Here, I learned the importance of adhering to safety standards and regulations.
- **Precision in Execution**: Every connection and wiring path had to be precise to ensure the circuit remained efficient and safe.

## Furniture Building, Rust Removal, and Interior Work
In addition to the electrical system, I worked on several interior projects. This included building furniture, laying the floor, and insulating the van. I also installed windows, a heater, and a water system, which required cutting into the vehicle body. These tasks added complexity to the project, as I needed to carefully plan and execute each step to avoid damaging the van's structure. Simultaneously, I focused on rust removal and protecting the vehicleâ€™s body to ensure longevity.

### What I Learned
- **Adapting to Unexpected Challenges**: During the furniture construction and interior modifications, I had to be flexible and adapt to challenges, such as limited and uneven space.
- **Attention to Detail**: Rust removal, insulation, and cutting the body for the water system and windows required precision and patience to prevent long-term damage.
- **Holistic Approach**: Balancing multiple tasks like flooring, insulation, and integrating a heating and water system taught me the importance of coordinating different components and systems for a seamless build.

## Conclusion
This project not only helped me develop technical skills but also greatly improved my **planning and project management** abilities. I learned the importance of planning technical details in advance and solving potential problems before they arise. The experience has strengthened my ability to successfully execute complex projects, managing both technical and organizational challenges along the way.
